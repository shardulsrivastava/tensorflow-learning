# Tensorflow Learning

This is the repo for python code used for learning tensorflow.


## Building a simple Model 

This model [addition.py](addition.py), adds two number using tensorflow.

Using tensorflow version 1.13.1, because latest tensorflow version wasn't working :laughing:

To get rid of warnings from NumPy , added the code

```python
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
